Problem Management

Known Errors - Would be good to migrate a lot of the know errors from the Knowledge Base into Known Errors, as what I imagine we will be able to do, is link incidents which relate to the Known Error. Although a lot of the time with known errors, they're a lot of the same, but by linking incidents you can look at any intracies for specific cases, as well as pull off particular machines, users and begin to draw some common denominators with them and then look at resolving.

Problems - possible vulnerabilities that may need flagging because at the moment we have a system of possibly a singular incident, or perhaps just an email sent to Tom Mann for example, here's the info for this potential risk. Not to say Tom wouldn't action that, but if we instead sent Tom a problem ID with a collation of information, incidents or queries that have been raised and linked to that problem. So Tom can begin to look at the details of thaat. Also software errors, again they're populated in knowledge base but would be good to raise as problems, link specific incidents and then if we see a growing number over time, we can then reach out to the vendor to say we're seeing this, and we have all the info to hand.

Automated proactive alerts are something that I think would be good, why do we see COBIS issues raised every Tuesday at 10-11.

Designated problem operators - set tasks and duties with them mostly because it would be great to have AI proactive problem creation and remedial work, having set duties allows the person managing the problem to be aware of the issues and a lot of the time join up the dots.
