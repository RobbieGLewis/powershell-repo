Deny Assignments - block users from performing specific actions, even if a role allows it. Done through Azure Blueprints 




Classic Administrators
Original role system, should use RBAC when possible
Three types - account administrator (subscription owner) service administrator (global) co-administrator (subscription owner)

RBAC
Helps manage who has access to Azure resources and what areas
Role assignement 3 elements - security prinicpal, role definition and scope.
Security principal, identity requesting access to resource, could be a user wanting access, a group, or service principal (generic)
Scope - access to set of resources, vms associated dbs
Role definition - read0rwite and delete - owner contributor reader and user access admin
